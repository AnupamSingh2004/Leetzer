# This is a placeholder for extension icons
# In a real implementation, you would have:
# - icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
# - icon32.png (32x32 pixels) 
# - icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
# - icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

# These should be PNG files with the extension logo/branding
# For now, you can use any 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, and 128x128 pixel PNG files
# or create them using design tools like Figma, Canva, or GIMP

# Example icon requirements:
# - Clear, recognizable design
# - Works well at small sizes
# - Represents code analysis/AI theme
# - Brain icon (ðŸ§ ) or similar analytical symbol would be appropriate
